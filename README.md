A Python terminal, running over xterm, designed for calculator use. This is NOT a calculator, it is a terminal designed to maximize Python's calculating capabilities. Best used with a numpad, Pypad maximizes convenience. I like to see it as a TI-30 calculator: It will not solve the world, but ultimately it's always there.

not numpy, because, well, that exists
